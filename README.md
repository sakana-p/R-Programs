## Basic interger programming

Problem that we solve:

max: 8 x1 + 5 x2;

with constraints

x1 + x2 <= 6;

9 x1 + 5 x2 <= 45;


### Installation

To install the stable version from CRAN, simply run the following from an R console:

 install.packages("lpSolveAPI")
 
### Deployment
 
 Download all the ".lp" files in a single file.
 
 Run ip.Rmd file.


## Laws of Returns to Scale-crs-vrs-fdh-drs-irs-frh- plots

The model gives basic idea how to use the Laws of Returns to scale and compare the outputs

#### Installation

To install the stable version from CRAN, simply run the following from an R console:

 install.packages("Benchmarking") 
 
 ### Deployment
 
 Download and run models.Rmd file.
 The output will be in the form of graphs.


## SUM OF SQUARES OF ERROR-GA_GenSA

Here we find the sum of squares of errors using Genetic Algorithem and Generalized Simulated Annealing.

We also use ggplot for plotting the output

### Installation

To install the stable version from CRAN, simply run the following from an R console:

install.packages("GenSA")

install.packages("ggplot2")

install.packages("GA")

install.packages("knitr")

install.packages("kableExtra")

### Deployment

Copy "Create sse.rmd" file.

The resulting output willbe in the form of a table showing sse of GA ans genSA.

And also the a ggplot is created in the end.

## Portfolio using GenSA and GA

In this program we show how to use GenSA and GA to give optimal values to invest on given Portfolio

### Installation 

To install the stable version from CRAN, simply run the following from an R console:

install.packages("GenSA")

install.packages("ggplot2")

install.packages("GA")

install.packages("knitr")

install.packages("kableExtra")

install.packages("quantmod")

### Deployment

copy and run "gensa_ga.Rmd" file in R studio.

Resulting output will be in the for of table comparing the results od GA and GenSA.
